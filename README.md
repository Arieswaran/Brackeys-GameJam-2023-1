#Project: Xenomouse
In Project: Xenomouse, a scientist seeks to save the world with the perfect mutant mouse. 



RAISE the xenomouse so it grows into its body’s full potential.

Feed the xenomouse
Brush the xenomouse
Play with the xenomouse
RUN the xenomouse through a maze to complete a field test.

Reach the end of the maze
Avoid catamanders
Collect cheese
REVIVE the xenomouse when it dies in the test, inevitably revealing its failings and weakness. Use its carcass to improve your next xenomouse.



Once the xenomouse makes it to the end of the maze, you have scientific evidence of its capability to save the world! (Don’t ask dumb questions like “how?”) Enjoy toying with the sanctity of life!
